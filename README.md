Hello, I am 11771 (not my actual name).
I live in the south eastern part of the United States.
I like learning to code and want to make a computer science/cyber security career where I can code different things.
I hate debugging.
I like this platform even though it is new to me and I have never used it before (very useful for maintaining a collective mind where you can make edits to files without messing up the orignal; like I am doing right now). 
That is all, have a great day.
